# CRAWLER
I record my learning process here. If you want to take, feel free to take it.

In addition, I also write my learning notes in Chinese [here](https://hackmd.io/8d73tSj0S9CWfXXX2TC12A?both)

(I don't own these code on my notes, example code resources are download from [https://deepmind.com.tw/](https://deepmind.com.tw/))

Before you trying to run the code, check your webdriver's version
